<h2>Data Flow</h2>
<img src="Program Execution Explanation.png" height="700">
<h2>Program Execution</h2>
<p>When the tool is executed, it will call the Main.ps1 script to run which will get the list of servers and run the <a href="#DataSheet">DataSheet.ps1</a> script. This script will run the data collection scripts concurrently and return the collected data to the DataSheet script. The DataSheet script will generate a report file which can be viewed in the web page.</p>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The tool will collect the following information from the given list of servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#VersionData">Application Version</a></li>
<li><a href="#DriveSpace">Drive Space</a></li>
<li><a href="#PhysicalMemory">Memory Space</a></li>

<h2><a id="Comments"></a>Config.ps1</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>This script defines a table variable called $config with several configuration values. These are the paths to the computer list file, the baseline file, service filter file, reports file, and reports folder. This script is loaded whenever any of these values are used (in DataSheet.ps1, Main.ps1, and DeleteOldReports.ps1). Note: when editing the reports folder path, it also needs to be updated in displayReport.js and AdminTool.java.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="DataSheet"></a>DataSheet.ps1</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>This PowerShell script unites all of the data collection powershell scripts under one umbrella by loading all of the necessary data to memory prior to running and feeding the necessary data to each powershell script background job as necessary. Once the data collection scripts are loaded into memory, the scripts will be started as concurrent background tasks to collect all of the data on separate threads. All of the results of the each script will be stored in a JSON object. The script also includes error-catching functionality if any scripts return null values or have other errors.</li>
<li>All of the baseline files that were utilized for the filtering will also be included in the JSON object. This data is not be included in the visual reports, however, since all of this information is present in the baselines in the admin tool. The purpose of this data is to provide the administrator with the original baseline file information in the case that the information was changed later.</li>
<li>The report file name will be created through the parsing of time elements starting with date and ending with the time the program collected all of the necessary data.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="VersionData"></a>VersionData.ps1</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>VersionData is a method for collecting data about the installed applications on a given computer/server. VersionData works by accessing the system's 32-bit and 64-bit uninstall list and unifying them into a singular list of applications. While the applications are being checked, there is a hard-coded filter that ignores any bloatware that may be installed on the system. These keywords can be changed/modified in the code if you find there are applications coming up that you may not care about seeing any information on. The ignored applications are stored in an array bin and displayed to the console if the -ShowIgnored Parameter is defined as true. The program then checks for a baseline file if it was provided in the -BaseLinePath parameter. The -BaseLinePath is tested for file existence, compatibility, and proper formatting. If everything checks out, the file is imported and then the program will compare the gathered version data against the baseline file. If there is a problem with importing the file at any point, there will be an error message and that will be the end of that iteration of the script. The program compares the current version of the application against the baseline file, and then makes a decision as to what to assign the application object's status. After the status of each application has been defined the program will output the array of application objects. The process is repeated for each computer name given.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>BaseLinePath</strong> (Optional): A string of the file path to location of desired base line file.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>ShowIgnored</strong> (Optional): Boolean that determines whether or not the user wishes to view all ignored applications in the console.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>ComputerNames</strong> (Optional): A string array that specifies the other computers that the script will run on.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<ul>
<li>A table containing the columns ComputerName, Name, Version, and Status.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Execute VersionData without a baseline file, just to see what is installed on local computer<br /><span class="code">Get-VersionData</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Execute VersionData with a baseline file, to compare local applications and show any applications that were deemed bloatware<br /><span class="code">Get-VersionData -BaseLinePath "C:/User/Desktop/baseLine.csv" -ShowIgnored true</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Execute VersionData to run with multiple computer names<br /><span class="code">Get-VersionData -ComputerNames "CMH1097743, HVM1141800"</span></li>
</ul>

<h1><a id="HTML_CSS_JavaScript"></a>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Index.html</h2>
<p>This is the home page for the web interface. It contains the list of reports and links to the short and full views for each one. The HTML file itself only defines a table and loads reports.js and listReports.js.</p>

<h2>Report.html</h2>
<p>This is the page that displays either the short view or the full view. It defines a div for each type of data in a report and loads in displayReport.js. This should be opened like: report.html?short=true&id=20190410T151752. Information about the parameters can be seen <a href="#displayReport">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Newtooltip.css</h2>
<p>This is a styling sheet that will allow the administrator to change the look and feel of the web browser rendering of the reports. Here is where the administrator would change the size of the text, select a different color for the highlight and size of the tables, and even add more details to a already pre-existing class or HTML elements.</p>

<h2><a id="displayReport"></a>displayReport.js</h2>
<p>This script reads the short and id parameters from the url. The id is the report to display (report should be stored in reports\id.js). If the id parameter is missing or invalid, no report will be displayed. The short parameter is whether to display the report in the short or full view. If short has a value of true, the short view will be displayed. If short is any other value or missing, the full view will be displayed. To display a report, this script loads id.js and either <a href="#shortView">shortView.js</a> or <a href="#fullView">fullView.js</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="fullView"></a>fullView.js</h2>
<p>This script is the same as shortView.js, except all of the information is shown and not filtered. For more information, look at the <a href="#shortView">shortView.js</a> description.</p>

<h2>listReports.js</h2>
<p>This script reads the reports variable from reports.js, and add links for each report. The url for each link is report.html?short=(true|false)&id=report_id.</p>

<h2>reports.js</h2>
<p>This contains the list of reports on the computer. It simply defines an array of strings where each string is an id for a report. The id for each report is the file name without the file extension (.js). This array is then accessed by listReports.js to display the list of reports. Each id is kept on a seperate line, and the file is appended each time a new report is generated. Whenever a report is deleted, it should be deleted from this file as well, or it will still appear on index.html.</p>

<h2><a id="shortView"></a>shortView.js</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>This script reads the data loaded into the web page and displays it in tables with red highlights and filtering. From the web page, it loads the following: reportTime, comment, versionData, driveData, ipData, osData, memoryData, timeData, and servicesData. After loading this data, it applies a function to the data that adds the data to the DOM.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>addReportTime(data, id)</strong>: Adds the time the report was generated, "data", into the DOM element "id".</li>
<li><strong>addReportComments(data, id)</strong>: Adds the comment in the report, "data", into the DOM element "id".</li>
<li><strong>addElement(data, id, heading, func)</strong>: Function to be run when the document is loaded. It adds the given "data" into the specified DOM element "id". A header "heading" is also added to the DOM element. There is a tooltip that changes based on each id. The "func" defines the function that will generate the table and what kind of filtering/highlighting will be applied.</li>
<li><strong>versionHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Generates an array of rows to be added to the DOM for the application version data. If the status is not "OK", then it will give the row the red-highlight class.</li>
<li><strong>driveHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Generates an array of rows to be added to the DOM for the drive data. If the FreeGB is less than 5, then the function will give the row the red-highlight class. If the FreeGB is not less than 5, it will not be added to the row array.</li>
<li><strong>memoryHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Generates an array of rows to be added to the DOM for the memory data. If the PctFree is less than 5, then it the function will give the row the red-highlight class. If the PctFree is not less than 5, it will not be added to the row array.</li>
<li><strong>timeHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Generates an array of rows to be added to the DOM for the time data. The row will get the red-highlight class if the StandardTimeZone doesn't match, if the DaylightTimeZone doesn't match, or if the time difference is more than 2 minutes. Else, the row will not be added to the row array.</li>
<li><strong>servicesHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Generates an array of rows to be added to the DOM for the services data. The row will get the red-highlight class if the StartMode is Auto, the State is Stopped, and the Ignore value is false. Else, the row will not be added to the row array.</li>
<li><strong>noHighlight(data, keys)</strong>: Returns an array of rows with all of the table data and keys. This does not apply any highlighting to the rows.</li>
<li><strong>CreateRow(data, keys)</strong>: Creates a table row element and fills it with the row's data. Returns the DOM element of the table row.</li>
<li><strong>getVersion()</strong>: JS function to call the Element ID "version-data" in the HTML file in order to display and hide the current section.</li>
<li><strong>getDrive()</strong>: JS function to call the Element ID "drive-data" in the HTML file in order to display and hide the current section.</li>
